# Stepcharts

This is a website where Dance Dance Revolution players can browse step charts from the game. The goal is to eventually cover other games like In The Groove as well.

Deployed here: https://ddr.stepcharts.com (original URL)

## Status

A rather solid and decently featured version of the site is live and deployed.

### Current features

* all official DDR arcade songs except for Ace for Aces and Chaos Terror Tech-Mix because those two songs require a ssc parser.
* Responsive design, stepcharts are easy to navigate and use on a phone
* printer friendly, printing a stepchart causes it to wrap into columns and utilize the space on the page effectively
* song analysis: jumps, freezes, gallops, stops, drills, tempo shifts, bpm
* all songs page with filtering and sorting
* link to a specific beat in a song, useful if asking for help on a certain part of a song

### Still to come features

* ssc parser for the two missing songs
* an "adhoc" page where people can load their own songs, and also share them with other people (via storing the data in the url, this site has no backend)
* more song analysis: crossovers, freeze crossovers, spins, etc
* playlist creation: collect songs you are interested in into a playlist that (hopefully) can be loaded into stepmania
* normalize difficulties to the new scale using RemyWiki data
  
### stretch goal: make stepcharts accurate

Since there are thousands of songs created by many people over the course of 20 years, the accuracy of stepmania stepcharts is in question. It'd be great if this site could grow to address this problem. Something like having a stepchart editor that enables people to make tweaks that fix inaccuracies, and ultimately this site becomes a source of truth on accurate step charts for all DDR mixes. 

This is a big undertaking and unsure if it will ever come to fruition

### Current Goals
* Add remaining DDR A20 charts (if there even are any left)
* Add DDR A20+ charts
* Add DDR A3 charts
* I want to do the ssc parser??? It's probably super hard but I wanna see if it's doable
* (2022-06-09 9:14 AM MST) I just noticed this doesn't have Dancing Stage feat. TRUE KiSS DESTiNATiON nor does this have some of the DDR Solo megamixes
* Rename the style short-forms for SuperNOVA 1 and 2 to SN1 and SN2
